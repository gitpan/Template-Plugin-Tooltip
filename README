DESCRIPTION
    Template::Plugin::Tooltip is a Template Toolkit hook to the marvelous
    HTML::Tooltip::Javascript module.

    The first version was written in 30 minutes following the talk on
    HTML::Tooltip::Javascript at the Open Source Developers Conference, just
    after its initial release.

  API Overview
    This module is very much just a thin layer over the top of the
    HTML::Tooltip::JavaScript API, and you should probably go read and
    understand its API before using this module.

    To summarise VERY briefly, when you load in the plugin, the params go as
    params to the H::T::Javascript "new" constructor, with the new Tooltip
    object stored internally. When you create a tooltip, the HTML content
    and parameters are passed directly to H::T::Javascript "tooltip" method.

  Loading the Tooltip Generator
    To load the tooltip generator with the default options, you can simple
    do the following.

      [% USE Tooltip %]

    In the same way you pass params to the HTML::Tooltip::Javascript
    constructor, you can also pass params when loading in the Tooltip
    plugin.

      [% USE Tooltip('param', 'value') %]

  Using the Tooltip Generator
    HTML::Tooltip::Javascript provides one simple method through which you
    generate all the different tooltips.

    In Template::Plugin::Tooltip, you just use the loaded plugin directly.

      [% Tooltip( 'This is my plain tooltip' ) %]

    This only generates the Javascript tag properties, so this needs to be
    used within a tag, like an anchor tag.

      <a href="#item" [% Tooltip('A tooltip') %]>item</a>

    The first param is literal HTML content, and you can provide any
    additional parameters you want for the tooltip, as you would do create
    the tooltip directly.

      <a href="#item" [% Tooltip('A tooltip', 'bgcolor', 'pink') %]>item</a>

  Initialising the Tooltip Library
    The one additional step you will need to do is load in the tooltip
    JavaScript library that drives the whole thing.

    To do this, simple add the following to the end of the page, or to the
    <head> section of your HTML document.

      [% Tooltip() %]

  Use as a Filter
